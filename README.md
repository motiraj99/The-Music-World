# The-Music-World

This is a C++ project done while in high school together with my fried Debajyoti Mazumdar. Here we assume having a CD/DVD shop and the aim of
all this is to manage sell of items, addition of new CD's, calculating price, login of owner etc. We have used simple file handling techniques 
C++ to implement all.
